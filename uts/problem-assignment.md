# Problem Assignment UTS

## 1. Slice and Subslice:
Write a Go program that defines a slice of integers named numbers with the values 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. Create three subslices:
Subslice1 containing the first three values.
Subslice2 containing the last three values.
Subslice3 containing the second and fourth values.
Print out all four slices.

## 2. Strings and Runes:
Define a string variable called message with the value "Good Morning ☀️". Print the fourth rune in the string as a character.

## 3. Structs:
Define a struct called Book with fields title, author, and pages. Create three instances of this struct with different values using different initialization methods.
Print out all three instances.

## 4. Functions and Slices:
Write a Go function named sliceSum that accepts a slice of integers and returns the sum of all elements in the slice.
Test the function with a slice containing the values 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.

## 5. Pointers:
Define a variable x with the value 100. Declare a pointer px pointing to x. Print the value and memory address of both x and *px.
Modify the value of x through px and print the updated value of x.

## 6. Closures:
Write a Go program that defines a function counter which returns a closure. The closure increments a variable count each time it's called and returns the current count.
Create two counter instances and demonstrate their independence.

## 7. Array and Slices:
Define an array arr with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Convert the array to a slice slic and print it.
Append the values 6 and 7 to the slice and print the modified slice.
